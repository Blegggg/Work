# Add descriptions ig

1- Proposal Overview

2- Key requirements of the brief

3- Data handling

4- Risk management

5- Wider issues

6- Current practices in emerging technology

7- Functional and non functional requirements



# General knowledge (might move into specific areas)


Produce a detailed proposal for a digital solution that you would develop to meet the needs of the scenario, should provide a rationale for the solution and include:

1- the business context

2- the functional and non functional requirements of the solution

3- decomposition of the problems that will need to be solved to implement the function and non functional requirements

4- KPI's and user acceptance criteria for proposed solution

5- justification of how the reccomended solution meets needs of clients and users, how risks will be mitigated, how relevant regulatory guidlines and legal requirements in relation to software development and the education sector will be addressed.



# User needs and client requirements

1- Stakeholder analysis: identify and evaluate intrests and influence of all parties involved in a project to ensure their needs are addressed.

2- User persona development: detailed profile of target users, get this from research to understand their behaviour, needs and motivation.

3- Use case scenarios: Specific examples of how users will interact with the product or service to clarify functionality and benefits.

4- accessibility: ensure products are designed to be usable with disabilities, stuff like text to speech. 

5- performance: define the expected outcomes and benchmarks for a project to ensure it meeds user needs and operates effectively under various conditions

6- Technical risks: identify potential issues related to technology implementation that could impact various things in the project like the success from things like system failures or integration challenges.

7- Business risks: Assess factors that could negatively affect the organisations objectives such as market changes financial instability and competition.

8- Security considerations; Eva;iate the measures necessary to protect sensitive data and systems from unauthorised access, breaches and other threats.

9- compliance requirements: understand legal and regulatory standards that you must adhere to in order to operate within law and industry guidlines, GDPR mainly.

10- Mitigation strategies: Develip plants to reduce or eliminate identified risks, ensuring the potential problems are addressed proactively to safeguard project success.


# Design documentation

Produce a set of design documents for the digital solution being proposed.

1- Visual/interface designs
2- data requirements 
3- a selection of algorithm designs
4- test strategy

Basically a blueprint for the software project, outlining what you are making, how it will work and how it will look.
The info helps keep everyone on the same page and know what is going to happen.

# Visual interface designs

Need to focus on many key components to achieve a good grade.

1- Design detail
Basically good detail in general, can't be bad.

2- Layout and good space
Needs to have good layout meaning it all merges well together 

3- Visual hierarchies
More important things like titles are the biggest.

4- common conventions
things normally done like the golden triangle for stuff to lie in.

5- general good design features
good colour scheme, format...
